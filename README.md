# 📊 Open 3D dataset Collection: A Guideline for Choosing Relevant 3D Datasets

## 📌 Description

This repository was created as part of the publication **"[Paper Title]"** (see citation below). 

It provides an alphabetically organized collection of various published 3D datasets, along with comparable dataset characteristics 
to support researchers in selecting suitable datasets for application-specific machine learning tasks. 

⚠️ **Note:** This repository does *not* host any 3D datasets.  
It only includes references to external sources where the original datasets can be accessed.

The repository is divided into three main folders: 

- **[Dataset-Collection](./Dataset-Collection)**:  
  Contains an overview of datasets, along with comparable dataset characteristics  
  _(e.g., S3DIS, ScanNet, KITTI)_.

- **[Dataset-Properties](./Dataset-Properties)**:  
  Defines and describes key dataset characteristics and their relevance  
  _(e.g., publication year, indoor/outdoor)_.

- **[Dataset-Statistics](./Dataset-Statistics)**:  
  Includes statistical analyses and plots based on the dataset collection  
  _(e.g., distribution by publication year)_.
